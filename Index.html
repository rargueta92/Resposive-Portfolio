                    Born and raise in Colorado. My dad is from El Salvador and my mom is from Mexico. I have a older brother 5 years apart and a younger brother 
                    that is 12 years apart from myself. I'm 26 years old from the valley of Glenwood Springs (near Aspen if you don't know). I bought a house when I was 21 in Denver 
                    but only lived in the city for 2 years.

                    I attended Metroplitan University of Denver and also Colorado Mountain College for a couple years but didn't get
                    my degree. One of my favorite hobbies is watching and playing soccer. I've been known to be to obsessed with it! 
                    I do also enjoy watching football, a long with fighting sports.

                    I also like the outdoors like hiking and camping. I've hiked many different trails in Colorado but I would like to do more. 
                    I have yet to do a Fourtener! I enjoy the outdoors, as well as traveling to new areas. 
                    I've been able travel to Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua but want to conquer more. 
                    I hope to suceed in the program and I look forward to achieving my goal.
